              &#8220;I’ve had the pleasure of working with Stephanie Taylor for
              15 years. During this time, she has assisted my clients with
              creative solutions to help them achieve their goal of opening
              their dream business or refreshing current spaces.  She is
              trustworthy and a hard worker, always willing to go the extra mile
              for the perfect lending solution.  The thanks I receive from
              customers after referring them to Stephanie is all the proof I
              need that she is always the right partner for me.&#8221;

              open experience for my team and customers.  Grateful to have her
              as a financing resource for my customers.&#8221;
