            <strong>Use of cookies</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            A cookie is a small simple file that is stored by your browser on
            the hard drive of your computer or device and sent when you visit a
            website. The information stored in cookies is then returned
            (depending on the cookie) to our servers (or to the servers of the
            relevant third parties) on a subsequent visit. Doing so, Cookies
            transmit small amounts of data about your device to the relevant web
            server and enables a website to recognize your computer, smartphone,
            or other device.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            Whilst cookies can be classified through their Lifespan, i.e.,
            whether they remain stored on your device for the duration of your
            browsing session, session cookies, or permanently until they are
            deleted or expire, permanent cookies. A second method to classify
            cookies is by determining their origin or by who is placing a
            particular cookie. As such a distinction is drawn between
            first-party cookies and third-party cookies. First-party cookies are
            created directly by a website, whereas third-party cookies are
            created by a service provider. And because of that, each cookie
            stores different data and as such must be evaluated individually
            which then leads to several types of cookies<em>.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            The least privacy invasive type of cookies are{" "}
            <em>Essential or Necessary cookies</em>. These cookies are essential
            or necessary to ensure that a website works properly and is secure
            so that you can navigate a website and use its features. Without
            these cookies, certain features of a website would not function, and
            thus you would not be able to use certain services.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            There are also <em>Functional cookies</em> or sometimes called
            convenience cookies. These cookies allow a website to remember the
            options a user has made (including user IDs stored, consents given,
            or languages selected) and other personalization options you have
            selected when browsing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Further there are also{" "}
            <em>Analysis and performance cookies,&nbsp;</em>which are used to
            monitor and improve the function and service of a website. Those can
            track down problems when using a website, facilitate online surveys,
            record visitor numbers, and provide analytics metrics.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Lastly, Advertising cookies or targeting cookies.&nbsp;</em>They
            are used to deliver customized advertising to the user. This can be
            very convenient, but also very annoying.
          </p>
          <p>
            The use of cookies is regulated in the PECR. Accordingly, the use of
            functional, analysis and performance or advertising cookies require
            your consent and thus the legal basis for the use of personal data
            in relation to cookies, the use of cookies would then be your
            consent as well as our legitimate interest.&nbsp;

            <strong>The cookies we use that require your consent</strong>

            Below you can find the cookies we use listed in accordance with
            their Name, Description, Lifespan, and Type. Please keep in mind
            that this list may be updated from time to time.&nbsp;

                  visitor, session and campaign data and also keeps track of
                  site usage for the site&apos;s analytics report. The cookie
                  stores information anonymously and assigns a randomly
                  generated number to recognize unique visitors.
