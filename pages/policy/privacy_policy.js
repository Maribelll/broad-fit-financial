            Thank you for your interest in this Privacy Policy! Data protection
            is of a particularly high priority for the management of Broad Fit
            Financial. The use of our website is possible without any indication
            of personal data. However, if a data subject wants to use specific
            parts of our service via our website, processing of personal data
            could become necessary. If processing of personal data is necessary
            and if there is no legal basis for such processing, we will
            generally obtain the consent of the data subject.
          </p>
          <p>
            The processing of personal data, such as the name, address, e-mail
            address of a data subject shall always be in line with Florida`s
            Privacy Protection Act (&ldquo;FPPA&rdquo;), the General Data
            Protection Regulation (&ldquo;GDPR&rdquo;). By means of this privacy
            policy, we would like to inform the public about the type, scope and
            purpose of the personal data we collect, use and process.&nbsp;

          <p>
            As the controller, Broad Fit Financial has implemented numerous
            technical and organizational measures to ensure the most complete
            protection of personal data processed through this website.
            Nevertheless, Internet-based data transmissions may be subject to
            security vulnerabilities, so that absolute protection cannot be
            guaranteed. For this reason, every data subject is free to transmit
            personal data to us by alternative means, for example by telephone.

            <strong>Collection of general data and information</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            The website of Broad Fit Financial collects a series of general data
            and information every time a data subject or automated system calls
            up the website. This general data and information is stored in the
            log files of the server. The following data may be collected:&nbsp;
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>the browser types and versions used,&nbsp;</li>
            <li>the operating system used by the accessing system,&nbsp;</li>
            <li>
              the website from which an accessing system accesses our website
              (so-called referrer),&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
              the sub-websites that are accessed via an accessing system on our
              website,&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>the date and time of an access to the website,&nbsp;</li>
            <li>an Internet protocol address (IP address),&nbsp;</li>
            <li>
              the Internet service provider of the accessing system, and&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
              other similar data and information that serve to avert danger in
              the event of attacks on our information technology systems.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            When using these general data and information, Broad Fit Financial
            does not draw any conclusions about the data subject. Rather, this
            information is needed:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>to deliver the contents of our website correctly,&nbsp;</li>
            <li>
              to optimize the contents of our website and the advertising for
              these,&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
              to ensure the long-term functionality of our information
              technology systems and the technology of our website, and&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
              to provide law enforcement authorities with the information
              necessary for prosecution in the event of a cyberattack.&nbsp;
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Therefore, Broad Fit Financial analyses anonymously collected data
            and information on one hand for statistical purposes and on the
            other hand for the purpose of increasing the data protection and
            data security of our enterprise, and ultimately to ensure an optimal
            level of protection for the personal data we process. The anonymous
            data of the server log files are stored separately from any personal
            data provided by a data subject.

            <strong>Routine deletion and blocking of personal data</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            We process and store personal data of the data subject only for the
            period necessary to achieve the purpose of storage or were provided
            for by applicable legislation and statutory retention periods. If
            the storage purpose ceases to apply or if a storage period
            prescribed expires, the personal data will be routinely blocked or
            deleted in accordance with the statutory provisions.

          <p>
            <strong>Duration for which the personal data are stored</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            The criterion for the duration of the storage of personal data is
            the respective statutory retention period. After the expiry of the
            period, the corresponding data is routinely deleted, provided that
            it is no longer required for the fulfillment of the contract or the
            initiation of the contract.

            Legal or contractual provisions for the provision of personal data;
            necessity for the conclusion of the contract; obligation of the data
            subject to provide the personal data; possible consequences of
            non-provision
          </p>
          <p>
            We inform you that the provision of personal data is sometimes
            required by law (e.g., tax regulations) or may also result from
            contractual regulations (e.g., information on the contractual
            partner). Sometimes, in order to conclude a contract, it may be
            necessary for a data subject to provide us with personal data that
            must subsequently be processed by us. For example, the data subject
            is obliged to provide us with personal data if our company concludes
            a contract with him or her. Failure to provide the personal data
            would mean that the contract with the data subject could not be
            concluded. Before providing personal data by the data subject, the
            data subject must contact one of our employees. Our employee will
            explain to the data subject on a case-by-case basis whether the
            provision of the personal data is required by law or by contract or
            is necessary for the conclusion of the contract, whether there is an
            obligation to provide the personal data and what the consequences of
            not providing the personal data would be.

            We use within our online offer on the basis of our legitimate
            interests, content or services offered by third-party providers in
            order to integrate their content and services. &nbsp;This always
            requires that the third-party providers of this content are aware of
            your IP address, since the content or service could not send to your
            browser without the IP address. The IP address is thus required for
            the display of this content, and we endeavor to use providers that
            only use your IP address for the delivery of the content or
            services.&nbsp;

            However, Third-party providers may also use so-called pixel tags
            (invisible graphics, also known as &quot;web beacons&quot;) for
            statistical or marketing purposes. The &quot;pixel tags&quot; can be
            used to evaluate information such as visitor traffic on the pages of
            this website. The pseudonymous information may also be stored in
            cookies on the user&apos;s device and may contain, among other
            things, technical information about the browser and operating
            system, referring websites, time of visit and other information
            about the use of our online offer, as well as be linked to such
            information from other sources.
